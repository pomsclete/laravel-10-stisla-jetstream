    "History1" : "Created in 1925, the EPF, formerly the École Polytechnique Féminine, is one of the first Grandes Écoles in France to train women as engineers. Since that date, the school has continued to reinvent itself to train more than 12,000 innovative, daring and committed graduates, spread across all sectors of industry and services.",
    "History2" : "Since its creation, the EPF has cultivated a spirit of openness that is a hallmark of its identity. It is first of all an engineering school created by an engineer, Marie-Louise PARIS. Called the IEF (Institut Électromécanique Féminin), it trains young girls for an electromechanical engineering diploma. It also includes a short section, preparing for draftsman or assistant engineer positions. In 1933, the IEF became the École Polytechnique Féminine (EPF) with the addition of an additional year of study (from two to three years) and a section in aeronautics.",
    "History3" : "Public recognition will gradually be unanimous. In 1938, the EPF was authorized by the <a href='https://www.cti-commission.fr/' target='_blank'>Commission des Titles d'Ingénieurs</a> to issue the title of qualified engineer and in 1943 she was recognized by the State. In 1976, the school became a member of the <a href='https://www.cge.asso.fr/' target='_blank'>Conférence des Grandes Écoles</a>. In 1993, she joined the <a href='https://www.ugei.fr/' target='_blank'>UGEI</a> (Union des Grandes Écoles Indépendants) after obtaining the status of recognized foundation of public utility in 1991.",
    "History4" : "Since 1994, the school has no longer been reserved for women only, with men now being admitted. Despite this, and thanks to its history and experience, the EPF remains one of the schools where the rate of girls remains the highest (36%, twice the national average).",
    "History5" : "A school in full development",
    "History6" : "First located at the CNAM (National Conservatory of Arts and Crafts), the EPF moved in 1956 to accommodate its growing number of students. It was quite natural that she moved into the private house of its founder Marie-Louise Paris, in Sceaux.",
    "History7" : "The spirit of openness, diversity and diversity that drives the school in Sceaux has continued to manifest itself in its development. Under the leadership of its former director, Jean-Michel Nicolle, and thanks to its reputation for excellence, it has established privileged contacts with regional and departmental institutions as well as research centers. The school was thus able to open a campus in Troyes in 2010 then in Montpellier in 2012.",
    "History8" : "In January 2022, the EPF Paris site moved to a new site in Cachan to support its development project, and during 2023, the school will open a new campus in Saint-Nazaire.",
